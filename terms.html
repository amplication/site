            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will

            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our

            provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after
