            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our

            provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after

            revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop
